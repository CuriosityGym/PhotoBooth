The Photobooth is a novel way to click selfies using SMS

The photobooth application is a new generation spin on the old style photobooth, which allows you to take photos with friends. 
Users interact with the Photobooth using SMS, the display acknowledges the reciept of the SMS and starts a countdown timer.
After 5 seconds a photo of the group is taken. 
The photobooth then sends an SMS to the user with the link to download the photo. 



The clear need for the application is to have larger groups of people to participate together and take a picture, which selfie cameras cannot due to limited coverage of area. It acts as that helpful passerby who clicks a photo for you.
